## Heads up

- make w/ no args executes the first rule in makefile
- dependent files follow the ':' after the rule name.
  - If those files change, make will re-execute the rule.   

  [Rule Name]: [files...]
  hellomake: hellomake.c hellofunc.c
    gcc -o hellomake hellomake.c hellofunc.c -I. 

- ^^ A tab must start every command
  - e.g. the tab preceding gcc
